My name is Kobe Coleman, and I'm a junior in Allegheny College looking to major in Computer Science and minor in Music Theory.
I am a software developer primarily in C, Java, and Python, but I'm also starting to program in C#. I am also a bass player in the Pittsburgh Youth Symphony Orchestra, 
and I've been playing for ten plus years, looking to be a professional musician. That way, all of my options are open, and I have the highest chances of succeeding.
